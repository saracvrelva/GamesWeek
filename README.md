Angry Poops – Game 

//Project Description

My first group project took part in my 4th week at <Academia de Código_> #75 Bootcamp @ Lisboa.
We were challenged to create a game applying the technologies we had learned the previous weeks. The deadline for the project deployment: 10 nights! 
Important to mention that we still had classes between 9:30 am and 6pm. We could only work at the project after that.

// The Idea

After our brainstorm we decided to create a game that would make everyone laugh, even if it wasn't perfect. What would be funnier than having Shin Chan and his cute butt in our game? 
This way we decided to make our game around the idea that Shin Chan got too much Java and got stomach problems, making him poop everywhere. To help Shin Chan we created his sister (if you want to play this game you will be this character). Now his sister is responsible for collecting all the poop until she saves Shin Chan and wins the game. 
I don’t want to tell you everything just now. Go play our game to discover all the details!

//Development 

We started by designing a UML schema with all the classes, properties and methods we would need in our project. After that we separated our group into pairs, each one stayed with a responsibility (find images, create a story, start coding the classes…). We talked everyday about the progress and almost every two days we tried to reunite to discuss new features we could implement.
